AI-Powered Resume Ranker — Project Report (2 Pages)
1. Introduction

The recruitment process often involves screening hundreds of resumes for a single job role, which is time-consuming and inefficient when done manually. To automate and optimize this process, an AI-Powered Resume Ranker has been developed. This system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to evaluate and rank resumes based on their relevance to a specific job description. It speeds up candidate shortlisting and improves hiring efficiency.

2. Abstract

This project aims to automatically analyze and rank candidate resumes by comparing them against a given job description. The system extracts textual content from PDF resumes, preprocesses the data using spaCy, and converts text into numerical representations using TF-IDF vectorization. A custom scoring algorithm combining cosine similarity and keyword matching is used to determine the relevance of each resume. The project further includes a Flask-based web interface that allows users (HR/Recruiters) to upload multiple resumes and download ranking results. The system provides an efficient, scalable, and automated solution for resume screening.

3. Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: spaCy, scikit-learn, PyPDF2, pandas, NumPy

NLP Model: en_core_web_sm (spaCy)

Vectorization: TF-IDF

Framework: Flask (for web interface)

Other Tools: HTML/CSS (UI), Jinja Templates, CSV Reporting

4. Steps Involved in Building the Project
Step 1: Collect Input Data

Job description text is provided by the recruiter.

Multiple resumes are uploaded in PDF or text format.

Step 2: Extract Resume Text

Used PyPDF2 to extract text from PDF files.

Added support for .txt resumes as well.

Step 3: Preprocessing with spaCy

Converted text to lowercase

Tokenized sentences

Removed stopwords

Lemmatized words

Kept only meaningful tokens (nouns, verbs)

This ensures clean and comparable text for analysis.

Step 4: Vectorization Using TF-IDF

Converted preprocessed text into numerical vectors.

Applied TF-IDF to emphasize important keywords.

Step 5: Similarity & Ranking Algorithm

Calculated Cosine Similarity between job description and each resume.

Extracted important job-description keywords using spaCy (noun, verb, proper noun).

Combined both scores:

75% weight → TF-IDF cosine similarity

25% weight → Keyword match ratio

Step 6: Ranking the Resumes

Generated a final score between 0 and 1.

Sorted candidates in descending order of relevance.

Step 7: Web Application Development

Designed a Flask web UI where HR can:

Upload multiple resumes

Paste job description

View ranked results

Download report in CSV format

Step 8: Output Generation

Displayed ranking table through results.html

Allowed downloading HR report for record-keeping.

5. Conclusion

The AI-Powered Resume Ranker successfully automates the shortlisting process by applying NLP and Machine Learning techniques to evaluate resume relevance. The system significantly reduces manual screening time and increases the accuracy of candidate selection. With features like TF-IDF vectorization, keyword matching, and a simple web interface, the project is highly practical and industry-relevant. It can be further enhanced using advanced embeddings such as BERT or by adding OCR support for scanned resumes.
