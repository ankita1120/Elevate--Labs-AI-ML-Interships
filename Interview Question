1. How does logistic regression differ from linear regression?
Linear Regression	Logistic Regression
Predicts continuous values	Predicts probabilities
Uses least squares	Uses log-likelihood
Output can be any number	Output between 0 and 1
Line fitted by regression	Decision boundary formed by sigmoid
2. What is the sigmoid function?

The sigmoid converts any number to a probability:

𝜎
(
𝑧
)
=
1
1
+
𝑒
−
𝑧
σ(z)=
1+e
−z
1
	​


Used to map linear output → probability.

3. What is precision vs recall?

Precision: Out of all predicted positives, how many are really positive?

𝑃
𝑟
𝑒
𝑐
𝑖
𝑠
𝑖
𝑜
𝑛
=
𝑇
𝑃
𝑇
𝑃
+
𝐹
𝑃
Precision=
TP+FP
TP
	​


Recall: Out of actual positives, how many were predicted correctly?

𝑅
𝑒
𝑐
𝑎
𝑙
𝑙
=
𝑇
𝑃
𝑇
𝑃
+
𝐹
𝑁
Recall=
TP+FN
TP
	​

4. What is the ROC-AUC curve?

ROC plots TPR vs FPR at different thresholds

AUC (Area Under Curve) indicates model performance

AUC = 1 → perfect

AUC = 0.5 → random guessing

5. What is the confusion matrix?

A 2×2 table:

	Predicted 0	Predicted 1
Actual 0	TN	FP
Actual 1	FN	TP
6. What happens if classes are imbalanced?

Problems:

Model predicts majority class

Accuracy becomes misleading

Solutions:

Class weights (class_weight="balanced")

Oversampling (SMOTE)

Undersampling

Precision/Recall or ROC-AUC instead of accuracy

7. How do you choose the threshold?

Increase threshold → higher precision, lower recall

Decrease threshold → higher recall, lower precision

Choose based on business goal:

Medical → recall

Fraud detection → precision

8. Can logistic regression be used for multi-class problems?

Yes.
Scikit-learn uses:

One-vs-Rest (OvR) → default

Multinomial logistic regression → with solver='lbfgs'
