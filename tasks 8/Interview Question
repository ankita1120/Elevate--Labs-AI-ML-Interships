K-Means Interview Questions & Answers
1. How does K-Means clustering work?

K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data into K clusters based on similarity.

Steps:

Choose the number of clusters K.

Initialize K centroids (randomly or using K-Means++).

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid (cluster assignment step).

Recompute the centroids as the mean of all points in each cluster (centroid update step).

Repeat steps 3–4 until centroids stop changing (convergence).

It minimizes the within-cluster variance.

2. What is the Elbow Method?

A technique to choose the optimal number of clusters K.

Compute inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) for K = 1,2,3,…

Plot K vs. inertia.

Look for a point where the decrease in inertia slows down sharply —
this point looks like an elbow.

👉 That K is considered optimal.

3. What are the limitations of K-Means?

Requires specifying K in advance.

Sensitive to outliers — means get shifted easily.

Assumes spherical, equal-sized clusters.

Struggles with non-linear cluster shapes (e.g., concentric circles).

Sensitive to initialization — bad starting centroids → bad clustering.

Works only with numeric data.

4. How does initialization affect results?

If centroids are poorly initialized, K-Means may:

converge to a local optimum (bad clustering),

take more iterations,

split natural clusters incorrectly.

To improve:

Use K-Means++ initialization, which picks smarter starting centroids.

5. What is inertia in K-Means?

Inertia = sum of squared distances between points and their assigned centroid.

It measures:

how compact clusters are,

how well points fit their clusters.

Lower inertia = better clusters.

Used in Elbow Method.

6. What is Silhouette Score?

A metric to evaluate clustering quality.

Silhouette Score
=
𝑏
−
𝑎
max
⁡
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
Silhouette Score=
max(a,b)
b−a
	​


Where:

a = average distance to points in the same cluster

b = average distance to points in the nearest other cluster

Scores range from -1 to 1:

1 → well-separated clusters

0 → overlapping clusters

negative → wrong cluster assignment

7. How do you choose the right number of clusters?

Use multiple techniques:

✔ Elbow Method

Pick the elbow point in the inertia plot.

✔ Silhouette Score

Choose K with the highest silhouette score.

✔ Domain Knowledge

Business logic may require specific segments.

✔ Gap Statistic / Davies-Bouldin Index

Advanced evaluation methods.

8. What’s the difference between clustering and classification?
Clustering	Classification
Unsupervised learning	Supervised learning
No labels	Requires labeled data
Finds natural patterns/groups	Assigns data to predefined classes
Output: clusters	Output: class labels
Example: customer segmentation	Example: spam vs. non-spam
